### Tuts+ Tutorial: Core Data and Swift: Data Model

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

In the first article of this series, we learned about the Core Data stack, the heart of a Core Data application. We explored the managed object context, the persistent store coordinator, and the managed object model. This article focuses on the data model of a typical Core Data application. We zoom in on Xcode's data model editor and we take a look at entities, attributes, and relationships.
